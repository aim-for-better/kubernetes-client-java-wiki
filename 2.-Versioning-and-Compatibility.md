### Client versioning

The Java client uses Semantic Versioning. We increment the major version number whenever we
regenerate the client for a new Kubernetes release version (see table below). Whenever we do
this there are new APIs added and possibly breaking changes in the generated Kubernetes API
Stubs. Whenever you upgrade a major version, be prepared for potential breaking changes.

Key: 

* `✓` Exactly the same features / API objects in both java-client and the Kubernetes
  version.
* `+` java-client has features or api objects that may not be present in the
  Kubernetes cluster, but everything they have in common will work.
* `-` The Kubernetes cluster has features the java-client library can't use
  (additional API objects, etc).
* `x` The Kubernetes cluster has no guarantees to support the API client of
  this version, as it only promises _n_-2 version support. It is not tested,
  and operations using API versions that have been deprecated and removed in
  later server versions won't function correctly.

See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed description of changes
between java-client versions.
