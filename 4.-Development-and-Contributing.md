### Development

#### Update the generated code.

The code is generated by the [openapi-generator project](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

We have built general purpose cross-language tools for generating code, it is hosted in the
[kubernetes-client/gen](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/gen) repository.

To get started, in a root directory that is _not_ your `java` client directory, for example your
directory layout could be:
```
${HOME}/
        src/
             gen/
             java/
...
```

Then to clone the `gen` repository, you would run:

```sh
cd ${HOME}/src
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-client/gen
export GEN_ROOT=${PWD}
```

Then to update the client and run the formatter:

```sh
cd ${HOME}/src/java
${GEN_ROOT}/gen/openapi/java.sh kubernetes ./settings
./mvnw spotless:apply
```

This should run through a long-ish build process involving `docker` and eventually result in a new set of
generated code in the `kubernetes` directory.
